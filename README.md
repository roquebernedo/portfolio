# [My Portfolio Website](https://roquebernedo.netlify.app/)

My portfolio site was built from a Gatsby template, but i couldn't find it so i made it from scratch(i didn't use Gatsby for this portfolio). It was my first time working on a portfolio, as well as working with SaSS.

### `What i Changed`

. Added Nav buttons to quickly get to your desired section

. Added a new section for skills and changed section order (this messed with the original formatting quite a bit)

. Skills feature: I built a component that renders a different image of a burger depending on where on the burger the cursor hovers or clicks. The burger images were created in photoshop. I built one div with the burger nested inside, that has a sibling div (position: absolute, same height and width as the img) with 3 child divs each taking up about one third of that div's height. Those three divs had event listeners that triggered state change in React, which rendered a new burger img and skills set. Each skills set had to be a different component to trigger the animation. My favorite part of the site.

### `What i Learned`

. Created CSS Variables in SaSS

. Learned how to use clip-path in CSS

. Deployed a site to Netlify

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
