# [My Portfolio Website](https://roquebernedo.netlify.app/)

My portfolio site was built from a Gatsby template, but i couldn't find it so i made it from scratch(i didn't use Gatsby for this portfolio). It was my first time working on a portfolio, as well as working with SaSS.

### `Portfolio Parts`

<ul>
  <li>Presentation: Skills feature: I built a component that renders a different image of a burger depending on where on the burger the cursor hovers or clicks. The burger images were created in photoshop. I built one div with the burger nested inside, that has a sibling div (position: absolute, same height and width as the img) with 3 child divs each taking up about one third of that div's height. Those three divs had event listeners that triggered state change in React, which rendered a new burger img and skills set. Each skills set had to be a different component to trigger the animation.</li>

Added Nav buttons to quickly get to your desired section

Added a new section for skills and changed section order (this messed with the original formatting quite a bit)
