# [My Portfolio Website üçî](https://roquebernedo.netlify.app/)

My portfolio site was built from a Gatsby template, but i couldn't find it so i made it from scratch(i didn't use Gatsby for this portfolio). It was my first time working on a portfolio, as well as working with SaSS.

### `Portfolio Parts`

<ul>
  <li>Presentation: My presentation and nav buttons to quickly get to your desired section</li>
  <li>Skills: There is a component that renders a different image of a burger depending on where on the burger the cursor hovers or clicks. I built one div with the burger nested inside, that has a sibling div(position: absolute, same height and width as the img) with 3 child divs each taking up about one third of that div's height. Those three divs had event listeners that triggered state change in React, which rendered a new burger img and skills et. Each skills set had to be a different component to trigger the animation</li>
  <li>Projects: Section for my most important projects that I am working on</li>
  <li>About: Information about me, nothing new to reveal</li>
  <li>Contact: Built a Contact Form for any information</li>
</ul>

### `What i Learned`

<ul>
  <li>Created CSS Variables in SaSS</li>
  <li>Learned how to use clip-path in CSS</li>
  <li>Deployed a site to Netlify</li>
</ul>
